# Advent of Code 2018 Rust solutions.

[Advent of Code 2018][1] handily coincides with my intention to learn [Rust][2], so I'm using it to force myself to write a little [Rust][2] each day during December.

Expect the code in here to be na√Øve and not especially pretty. I'm primarily using it to train my brain with [Rust][2] syntax. Absorbing [Rust][2] idioms will come later.
